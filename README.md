# Intro to ML
Mobile carrier Megaline found that many of their subscribers use legacy plans.
They want to develop a model to analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.
The project is to develop a model to pick the right plan with the highest possible accuracy using behavior data about subscribers who already switched to the new plans.
